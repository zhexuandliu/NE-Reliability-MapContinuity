# A map continuity view of assessing and improving the reliability of neighbor embedding methods
We provide two diagnostic scores to assess and improve the reliability of neighbor embedding methods based on a map-continuity view. The perturbation score is to diagnose points around the location of overconfidence-inducing discontinuity and the singularity score is to diagnose points of fracture-inducing discontinuity. Our approach is flexible and works as a wrapper around many neighbor embedding algorithms. The R package is now available for t-SNE.

The method is based on the paper:

Liu, Z., Ma, R., Zhong, Y. (2023) Assessing and improving reliability of neighbor embedding methods: a map-continuity perspective. arXiv:2410.16608.
